# **Probability Distribution Calculator & Visualizer**

An interactive web application to compute, visualize, and understand probability distributions such as Binomial, Negative Binomial, Geometric, and Poisson.

This project was built as part of an academic assignment to demonstrate:
* Probability mass function (PMF) computations
  
* Graphical visualization using Chart.js
  
* Distribution properties (Mean & Variance formulas)

* User-friendly interface with tooltips, examples, and dynamic highlighting

# **Features**

### Supports Multiple Distributions: 

* Binomial, Negative Binomial, Geometric, Poisson

###  Flexible Probability Events:
  
* Exact (P(X = k))

* Less Than (P(X < k))

* Less Than or Equal (P(X ≤ k))

* Greater Than (P(X > k))

* Greater Than or Equal (P(X ≥ k))

### Interactive Graphs

* Probability bar chart generated with Chart.js

* Dynamic bar highlighting (e.g., all values ≤ k highlighted in red)

### Distribution Theory Section

* Built-in reference for PMF, Mean, Variance formulas with proper notation

* Short description/definition for each distribution

# Tech Stack

* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

* Chart.js for visualization

* Simple modular JS code

# How to Use

1. Select a distribution from the dropdown.

2. Enter required parameters (n, p, r, λ, k).

3. Choose event type (Exact, ≤, <, ≥, >).

4. Click Compute.

5. View results:

    * Calculated probability

    * Mean & Variance

    * Highlighted bar chart

    * Distribution formula reference

# Educational Value

This project is not just a calculator — it’s a learning tool:

* Reinforces understanding of probability distributions

* Shows how probability mass shifts with parameters

* Connects theory (formulas) with practice (computed & graphed results)

* Academic Assignment — Probability Distributions Visualization
